# COVID-19 Prediction using Cough Vid Dataset

## Overview
This project aims to predict COVID-19 infection using audio data from the Cough Vid dataset. The dataset consists of audio recordings of cough sounds from individuals, and our goal is to explore this data, conduct hypothesis testing, and develop machine learning models to predict COVID-19 infection based on these cough recordings.

## Hypothesis Testing
### Hypothesis
We hypothesize that there are distinguishable patterns or features in cough sounds that can differentiate between COVID-19 positive and negative cases.

### Approach
- **Data Exploration:** Exploring audio features, statistical analysis, and visualizations to identify patterns or differences between positive and negative cases.
- **Hypothesis Testing:** Using statistical tests (e.g., t-tests, ANOVA) to determine if there are significant differences in cough characteristics between COVID-19 positive and negative cases.

## Machine Learning Models
### Data Preparation
- **Feature Extraction:** Extracting relevant features from audio files (e.g., MFCCs, spectrograms).
- **Preprocessing:** Cleaning, scaling, and transforming the data for model input.

### Model Development
- **Baseline Models:** Implementing baseline models (e.g., Logistic Regression, SVM) for initial predictions.
- **Advanced Models:** Developing and fine-tuning more complex models (e.g., Random Forest, XGBoost, Neural Networks) for improved performance.

### Evaluation
- **Model Evaluation:** Assessing models based on metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, ROC-AUC.
- **Cross-validation:** Employing cross-validation techniques to validate model robustness.

### Model Deployment
- **Selection:** Choosing the best-performing model for deployment.
- **Deployment:** Integrating the selected model into production or further testing stages.
